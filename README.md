Deejays
================

The group was started in 2007 by Zach Pine, a co-organizer of Soul Sanctuary Dance, inspired by the generosity of two deejays who shared music ideas with him at the NCDC Summer Dance Camp.

Since 2019 Raisa Kaipainen is managing the group. https://tanssitemppeli.fi/

In 2016, Torsten RÃ¼ger provided a major technical upgrade, enabling the song database to
be searched and sorted, and automating membership functions.

Before Zach was doing the work by hand!
